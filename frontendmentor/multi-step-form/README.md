## My process

### Built with

- Only HTML & CSS
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- No js
- No frameforks

### What I learned

I learned a lot about how can I achive things with only css that I used to do with js. I know in a complicated project using only css isn't the correct approach and it's hard to maintain but this was a challenge for me.
